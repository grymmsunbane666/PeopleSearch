# PeopleSearch
A work-in-progress that is meant to scrape personal data about any individual from fastpeoplesearch.com. So far PeopleSearch can output a dictionary of phone numbers, emails, addresses, and family members based on a persons first and last name as well as an optional city and state. I have a number of ideas on where to take this but haven't settled on anything yet.
